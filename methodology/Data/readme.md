# Data Files for the SpiroMask Project

This folder houses essential raw data files for the SpiroMask project. These files are organized into the following subfolders:

## 1. Ground_Truth:
This folder holds valuable ground truth data related to the participants involved in the SpiroMask project. The data includes information such as age, weight, height, FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second), FVC (Forced Vital Capacity), PEF (Peak Expiratory Flow), presence of any lung ailment, and other relevant details. The data is stored in the form of a CSV file named `GroundTruth_Dataset.csv`.

## 2. SpiroMask_Audio_Samples: 
This folder holds a collection of audio samples that were meticulously gathered during the SpiroMask project. These audio files play a fundamental role in estimating lung health and evaluating the SpiroMask's efficacy. Through careful analysis of these samples, researchers can extract and analyze various respiratory parameters, including FEV1, FVC, and PEF. By measuring and comparing these metrics, researchers gain valuable insights into lung function and the potential impact of the SpiroMask on respiratory health.
